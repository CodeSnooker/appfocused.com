There are three vital elements of a flawless web application: modern user interface (UI) design, effortless user experience (UX) and, last but not least, immaculate execution of UI/UX, the so, called front-end development.

We are a team of software engineers specialising on execution of complex business-critical user interfaces on the web, desktop and mobile platforms. Accomplished UI execution not only brings the application to life, but also makes it secure and performant, available on different media and screen sizes, accessible for disabled users and many more. These are the features that your end-users care deeply about and our mission is to help your business to get it right.

With a highly technical team of JavaScript experts, we are at the leading edge of the newest and rapidly evolving technologies. Having lived and breathed modern web development for more than 10 years, we know how to tackle its trickiest aspects like security, performance, compatibility, responsive design and accessibility.

We help our clients to rapidly create digital products that drive growth, empower and enable an organisation to continuously learn, challenge and evolve.

We are front-end experts, but building great products would not be possible without knowledge and extensive usage of many other things, e.g. Node, Nginx, Serverless, PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS and many-many more. **TODO: check full list**

UI Architecture
There are plenty of considerations you need to make when building an architecture for a web application. We will help you navigate in the fast paced world of front-end technology and design a fit for purpose client-side stack and development workflow.

Front-end development
Not only we know how to build stunning standalone UI experiences, but we also have a good insight how to integrate front-end workflow into platforms like Adobe Experience Manager, Hybris, SalesForce, Power BI and Tableau.

Code Reviews and Audit
We will perform a thorough analysis of your web application that is assessing Performance, Code Quality & Semantics, Accessibility, UI and Usability issues. A report will document all recommendations and provide an immediately actionable plan.
